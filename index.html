            <p>You find yourself in a maze, the likes of which you've never seen before. You know that someone has been here before you: they've left a notebook with directions on how to escape.</p>
            <p>But that's not important. You're more concerned about what happened to them. These woods feel hungry, and if the person before you was the appetizer, then you're in danger of becoming the main meal.</p>
            <p>Search for clues as you navigate the maze. Maybe it will help.</p>
            <p><span class = "hidden_text">Or maybe it won't. Only one way to find out, don't you think?<br>
                <a class= "btn" href="fork_one.html">ENTER PATH</a></span></p>
